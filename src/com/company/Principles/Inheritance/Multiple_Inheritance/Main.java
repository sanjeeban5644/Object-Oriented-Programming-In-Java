    //Multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java.

    //The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity. The problem occurs when there exists methods
    //with the same signature in both the superclass and subclass.(Diamond Problem). On calling the method,
    //the compiler cannot determine which class method is to be called and even on calling
    //which method gets the priority.

    //This problem is solved in Java using Interfaces.
